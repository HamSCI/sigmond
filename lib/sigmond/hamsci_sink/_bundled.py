"""Local sink writer for HamSCI clients (CONTRACT §17).

Why this exists:
    On a sigmond client the local sink is just a store-and-forward
    buffer for `hs-uploader` to ship rows upstream.  SQLite gives a
    durable promise (rows survive a crash; the uploader reads at its
    own pace) at tens of MB of RAM and no daemon — the right shape for
    a host whose real job is running an SDR pipeline.

Where it lives:
    This module moved here from sigmond (`sigmond/lib/sigmond/
    hamsci_sink/writer.py`) in v3.70.  Clients still import it as
    `sigmond.hamsci_sink`, which prefers this module.  sigmond also
    carries a copy for venvs that hold no hs-uploader (D14), and a drift
    test holds the two together.  Keep this file stdlib-only and free of
    imports from the rest of `hs_uploader`, so that copy can stay a
    plain file copy.  The logger name and the `hamsci_sink:` message
    prefix stay as they were: operators grep them.

Selection (`Writer.from_env`):
    `SIGMOND_SQLITE_PATH` set → writer at that path (explicit override;
        useful for tests or unusual layouts).
    unset → the sigmond default `/var/lib/sigmond/sink.db`, IF that
        directory is writable.  Otherwise no-op — a true standalone
        client (no sigmond install) stays safe instead of erroring on
        every flush.

Storage shape:
    One queue table `pending_uploads` shared across modes:

        id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
        target_db       TEXT     -- e.g. "psk", "wspr", "timestd"
        target_table    TEXT     -- e.g. "spots", "noise", "events"
        schema_version  INTEGER
        payload_json    TEXT     -- the row, JSON-serialized
        queued_at       TEXT     -- ISO8601 UTC (writer wall-clock)
        producer        TEXT     -- the client that stored the row
        local           INTEGER  -- 1 = a local archive row (no caller sets it yet)

    `hs-uploader` reads rows in FIFO order, ships them upstream, and
    deletes on success.  JSON-on-disk means the uploader owns schema
    translation, not the producer — so producers stay decoupled from
    the upstream's column shape.

    `producer` and `local` arrived in v3.70 (tasks/plan-sink-control.md
    §10.4 item 2).  A writer that opens an older file adds both with
    ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN, which changes only the schema: SQLite
    rewrites no row.  Rows stored before v3.70 keep `producer = ''`, and
    readers name their producer with `infer_producer` (D12).  The writer
    stores `local = 0` on every row; a caller that keeps a local archive
    gains a way to say so in a later release.

Thread-safe: see `Writer`.
